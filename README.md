# Simulated Bank Transfer Email Template

This project contains an HTML email marketing template created with the help of PutsMail. The email simulates a PIX bank transfer notification, where a specified sender transfers funds to the recipient.
  

## Key Features: 

   * Branding: Includes a header image with the "EBAC Banking" logo.
   * Highlight Section: A bold notification alerts the recipient about the transfer.
   * Transfer Details:
     Displays the recipient's name.
     Highlights the sender (e.g., "XXX") and the amount (e.g., R$ 5,00).
     Mentions the transaction timestamp (e.g., 07/01/2024, 12:00).
   * Social Media Links: Includes icons linking to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for further engagement.
   * Responsive Design: Uses inline CSS for cross-email-client compatibility and adapts to various screen sizes.
  

## Use Case:
This email template is suitable for simulating or testing financial notification emails in a controlled environment, ensuring accurate rendering and user experience. It does not process real financial transactions.

## Tools Used:
* PutsMail: For testing email rendering across clients.
* HTML: To build the structure.
* Inline CSS: To ensure email client compatibility.
